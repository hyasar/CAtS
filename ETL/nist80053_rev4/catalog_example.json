Some of the account management requirements listed above can be implemented by organizational information systems. The identification of authorized users of the information system and the specification of access privileges reflects the requirements in other security controls in the security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on information system accounts receive additional scrutiny by appropriate organizational personnel (e.g., system owner, mission\/business owner, or chief information security officer) responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, by type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for authorizing access include, for example, restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-of-origin. In defining other account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements (e.g., scheduled maintenance, system upgrades) and mission\/business requirements, (e.g., time zone differences, customer requirements, remote access to support travel requirements). Failure to consider these factors could affect information system availability. Temporary and emergency accounts are accounts intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary accounts as a part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with infrequently used accounts (e.g., local logon accounts used for special tasks defined by organizations or when network resources are unavailable). Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts include, for example: (i) when shared\/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no longer required; or (ii) when individuals are transferred or terminated. Some types of information system accounts may require specialized training."],"links":[{"href":"#ac-3","rel":"related","RICHTEXT":"AC-3"},{"href":"#ac-4","rel":"related","RICHTEXT":"AC-4"},{"href":"#ac-5","rel":"related","RICHTEXT":"AC-5"},{"href":"#ac-6","rel":"related","RICHTEXT":"AC-6"},{"href":"#ac-10","rel":"related","RICHTEXT":"AC-10"},{"href":"#ac-17","rel":"related","RICHTEXT":"AC-17"},{"href":"#ac-19","rel":"related","RICHTEXT":"AC-19"},{"href":"#ac-20","rel":"related","RICHTEXT":"AC-20"},{"href":"#au-9","rel":"related","RICHTEXT":"AU-9"},{"href":"#ia-2","rel":"related","RICHTEXT":"IA-2"},{"href":"#ia-4","rel":"related","RICHTEXT":"IA-4"},{"href":"#ia-5","rel":"related","RICHTEXT":"IA-5"},{"href":"#ia-8","rel":"related","RICHTEXT":"IA-8"},{"href":"#cm-5","rel":"related","RICHTEXT":"CM-5"},{"href":"#cm-6","rel":"related","RICHTEXT":"CM-6"},{"href":"#cm-11","rel":"related","RICHTEXT":"CM-11"},{"href":"#ma-3","rel":"related","RICHTEXT":"MA-3"},{"href":"#ma-4","rel":"related","RICHTEXT":"MA-4"},{"href":"#ma-5","rel":"related","RICHTEXT":"MA-5"},{"href":"#pl-4","rel":"related","RICHTEXT":"PL-4"},{"href":"#sc-13","rel":"related","RICHTEXT":"SC-13"}]},{"id":"ac-2_obj","name":"objective","prose":["Determine

management. While user identities may remain relatively constant over time, user privileges may change more frequently based on ongoing mission\/business requirements and operational needs of organizations. Dynamic privilege management can include, for example, the immediate revocation of privileges from users, as opposed to requiring that users terminate and restart their sessions to reflect any changes in privileges. Dynamic privilege management can also refer to mechanisms that change the privileges of users based on dynamic rules as opposed to editing specific user profiles. This type of privilege management includes, for example, automatic adjustments of privileges if users are operating out of their normal work times, or if information systems are under duress or in emergency maintenance situations. This control enhancement also includes the ancillary effects of privilege changes, for example, the potential changes to encryption keys used for communications.
